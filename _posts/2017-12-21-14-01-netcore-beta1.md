**Web API OData Beta1** includes a new package for [OData V7.0.0 for ASP.NET Core 2.x](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData/). 
A nightly version of this package is available using this url: [https://www.myget.org/F/webapinetcore/api/v3/index.json](https://www.myget.org/F/webapinetcore/api/v3/index.json).

There is also a new Web API OData V7.0.0 for ASP.NET available as an Alpha, which you can access by downloading the packages
using this url: [https://www.myget.org/F/webapinetcore/api/v3/index.json](https://www.myget.org/F/webapinetcore/api/v3/index.json).

Both packages depends on [OData Lib 7.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Core/7.0.0).

The code for the packages can be found here:
[https://github.com/OData/WebApi/tree/feature/netcore](https://github.com/OData/WebApi/tree/feature/netcore)

### Known Issues

**Web API OData for ASP.NET Core**, has following limitations which are known issues:
* Batching is not supported
* Using EnableQuery in an HTTP route, i.e. non-ODta route, is not fully functional

**Web API OData for ASP.NET** , there are no known issues.

### OData V7.0.0 for ASP.NET Core 2.x

The new OData V7.0.0 for ASP.NET Core 2.x package supports the same features set as Web API OData V6.0.0 but works with ASP.NET Core.
You can learn more about ASP.NET Core from the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/).

To get started with OData V7.0.0 for ASP.NET Core 2.x, you can use code that is very similar to Web API OData V6.0.0. All of the
documentation in [Writing a simple OData V4 service](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#01-02-getting-started) is correct except for
configuring the OData endpoint. Instead of using the Register() method, you'll follow the new service + route configuration model
used in ASP.NET Core.

The namespace for both Web API OData packages is Microsoft.AspNet.OData.

Let's get started by creating a simple OData V4 service. It has one entity set `Products`, one entity type `Product`. `Product`
has two properties `ID` and `Name`, with `ID` being an integer and `Name` being a string. The service is read only. The only data
clients can get besides the service document and metadata document, is the `Products` entity set.

#### a. Create the Visual Studio project

In Visual Studio 2017, create a new C# project from the **ASP.NET Core Web Application** template. Name the project "ODataService".

In the New Project dialog, select **ASP.NET Core 2.0** and select the **WebApi** template. Click **OK**.

#### b. Install the OData packages

In the Nuget Package Manager, install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData` and all it's dependencies.

#### c. Add a model class

Add a C# class to the **Models** folder:

{% highlight csharp %}
namespace ODataService.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### d. Add a controller class

Add a C# class to the **Controllers** folder:

{% highlight csharp %}
namespace ODataService.Controllers
{
    public class ProductsController : ODataController
    {
        private List<Product> products = new List<Product>()
        {
            new Product()
            {
                ID = 1,
                Name = "Bread",
            }
        };

        public List<Product> Get()
        {
            return products;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the controller, we defined a `List<Product>` object which has one product element. It's considered as a in-memory storage
of the data of the OData service.

We also defined a `Get` method that returns the list of products. The method refers to the handling of HTTP GET requests. We'll
cover that in the sections about routing.

#### e. Configure the OData Endpoint

Open the file App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs. Replace the existing `ConfigureServices` and `ConfigureServices` methods with the
following code:

{% highlight csharp %}
public void  ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();
    services.AddOData();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    var builder = new ODataConventionModelBuilder(app.ApplicationServices);

    builder.EntitySet<Product>("Products");

    app.UseMvc(routeBuilder => routeBuilder.MapODataServiceRoute("ODataRoute", null, builder.GetEdmModel()));
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### f. Start the OData service

Start the OData service by running the project and open a browser to consume it. You should be able to get access to the service
document at `http://host/service/` in which `http://host/service/` is the root path of your service. The metadata document
can be accessed at `GET http://host:port/$metadata` and the products at `GET http://host:port/Products` where
`host:port` is the host and port of your service, usually something like `localhost:xxxx`.

#### g. Explore

As mentioned earlier, most of the samples for Web API OData V6.0.0 apply to Web API OData V7.0.0. One of the design goals was to keep
the API between the two as similar as possible. While the APIs are similar, they are not identical due to differences between
ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, such as HttpRequestMessage is now HttpRequest.

### OData V7.0.0 for ASP.NET Core 2.x

There is also a new Web API OData V7.0.0 for ASP.NET available as an Alpha, which you can access by downloading the packages
using this url: [https://www.myget.org/F/webapinetcore/api/v3/index.json](https://www.myget.org/F/webapinetcore/api/v3/index.json).
At this point, it contains the same feature set as [Web API OData V6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.OData/6.0.0)
but uses a different namespace: Microsoft.AspNet.OData. The API is the same except for the namespace.
