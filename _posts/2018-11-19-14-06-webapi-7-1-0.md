---

The NuGet packages for ASP.NET Web API OData v7.1.0 are available on the [NuGet gallery](https://www.nuget.org/).

You can install or update the NuGet packages for OData Web API v7.1.0 using the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console):

```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData -Version 7.1.0 
```
or
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.OData -Version 7.1.0
```

## Important Notes:
[issue #1591](https://github.com/OData/WebApi/issues/1591) fixes an issue where types created by the ODataModelBuilder did not respect the namespace of the ModelBuilder and instead used the namespace of the CLR type. With [PR #1592](https://github.com/OData/WebApi/pull/1592), OData WebAPI 7.1.0 now correctly uses the namespace on the ModelBuilder, if it has been explicitly set. In order to retain the old behavior of using the namespace of the CLR type, do not set the namespace on the ModelBuilder, or set the namespace on the ModelBuilder to null or to the desired namespace of the CLR type.
