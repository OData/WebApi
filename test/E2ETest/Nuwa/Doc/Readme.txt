Nuwa - A declaretive-based WebAPI runtime automation framework

----------------------------
Usage




----------------------------
To Do List:
1. [P1] Send warning when class is not marked by NuwaFramework Attribute
2. [P2] Add trace on and off option - run test twice with trace on/off
3. [P1] Global trace setting (NuwaTestClassCommand.cs) 
4. [P2] Abstract DelegatingTestClassCommand
5. [P2] Improve Trace checkup
6. [P2] The trace default policy is a mess...
7. [P2] SSL in self host


----------------------------
Some Facts:
1. The default host is webhost defined in NuwaFrameworkAttribute
2. Now by default the trace is turned off. (referee to NuwaTestClassCommand)
