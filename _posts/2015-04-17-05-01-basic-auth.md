We’re often asked by people if OData APIs can be secured. The name “Open Data Protocol” and the way we evangelize it (by focusing on how open a protocol it is and how it provides interoperability) may give people the impression that OData APIs doesn’t work with authentication and authorization. 

The fact is that using OData is orthogonal to authentication and authorization. That is to say, you may secure an OData API in any way you can secure a generic RESTful API.
We write this post to demonstrate it. The authentication methods we use in this post is the basic authentication over HTTPS. The service library we use is ASP.NET Web API for OData V4.0.

### Secure an OData Web API using basic authentication over HTTPS

[OData Protocol Version 4.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part1-protocol.html) has the following specification in section [12.1 Authentication](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata02/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata02-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Toc406398367):

> OData Services requiring authentication SHOULD consider supporting basic authentication as specified in [RFC2617] over HTTPS for the highest level of interoperability with generic clients. They MAY support other authentication methods.

Supporting basic authentication over HTTPS is relatively easy for OData Web API. Suppose you already have a working OData service project. In this post, we implemented an OData API which has only one entity type Product and exposes only one entity set Products. In order to secure Products, the following steps needs to be taken:

#### 1.	Create a custom `AuthorizeAttribute` for the basic authentication

Add a class to your project as follows:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class HttpBasicAuthorizeAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute
{
    public override void OnAuthorization(System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        if (actionContext.Request.Headers.Authorization != null)
        {
            // get the Authorization header value from the request and base64 decode it
            string userInfo = Encoding.Default.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(actionContext.Request.Headers.Authorization.Parameter));

            // custom authentication logic
            if (string.Equals(userInfo, string.Format("{0}:{1}", "Parry", "123456")))
            {
                IsAuthorized(actionContext);
            }
            else
            {
                HandleUnauthorizedRequest(actionContext);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            HandleUnauthorizedRequest(actionContext);
        }
    }

    protected override void HandleUnauthorizedRequest(System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        actionContext.Response = new HttpResponseMessage(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
        {
            ReasonPhrase = "Unauthorized"
        };
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

In this sample we name the attribute `HttpBasicAuthorizeAttribute`. It derives from `System.Web.Http.AuthorizeAttribute`. We override two of its methods: `OnAuthorization` and `HandleUnauthorizedRequest`.

In `OnAuthorization`, we first get the base64-encoded value of the header `Authorization` and decode it. Then we apply our custom authentication logic to verify if the decoded value is a valid one. In this sample, we compare the decoded value to “Parry:123456”. As is specified in [[RFC2617]](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata02/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata02-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#RFC2617), this value indicates that the username is “Parry” and password is “123456”.
In `HandleUnauthorizedRequest`, we handle unauthorized request by responding with HTTP status code `401 Unauthorized`.

#### 2. Decorate the controller with the custom `AuthorizeAttribute`

We decorate our `ProductsController` with `HttpBasicAuthorizeAttribute`:

{% highlight csharp %}
[HttpBasicAuthorize]
public class ProductsController : ODataController
{
	…
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### 3.	Enable HTTPS
In the project properties window, enable the SSL and remember the SSL URL:

#### 4.	Create a custom `AuthorizationFilterAttribute` for HTTPS
Add a class to your project as follows:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class RequireHttpsAttribute : AuthorizationFilterAttribute
{
    public override void OnAuthorization(HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        if (actionContext.Request.RequestUri.Scheme != Uri.UriSchemeHttps)
        {
            actionContext.Response = new HttpResponseMessage(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Forbidden)
            {
                ReasonPhrase = "HTTPS Required"
            };
        }
        else
        {
            base.OnAuthorization(actionContext);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this sample we name this class `RequireHttpsAttribute`. It derives from `System.Web.Http.Filters.AuthorizationFilterAttribute` and overrides its `OnAuthorization` method by responding with HTTP status code `403 HTTPS Required`.

#### 5.	Decorate the controller with the custom `AuthorizationFilterAttribute`

We further decorate our `ProductsController` with `RequireHttpsAttribute`:

{% highlight csharp %}
[HttpBasicAuthorize]
[RequireHttps]
public class ProductsController : ODataController
{
	…
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### 6.	Testing

We run the project to test it. When run for the first time, you’ll be asked to create a self-signed certificate. Follow the instruction to create the certificate and proceed. 

In the above steps, we’ve secured the OData API by allowing only HTTPS connections to the Products and responding with data only to requests that has a correct Authorization header value (the base64-encoded value of “Parry:123456”: UGFycnk6MTIzNDU2). Our HTTP service endpoint is `http://localhost:53277/` and our HTTPS endpoint is `https://localhost:43300/`. 

First of all, we send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:53277/Products`, and the service responds with an empty payload and the status code `403 HTTPS Required`.

![](https://github.com/LianwMS/WebApiF/blob/gh-pages/img/05-01-demo-1.png)
 
Then we send the request over HTTPS to `https://localhost:43300/Products`. Since the basic authentication info needs to be provided. The service responds with an empty payload and the status code `401 Unauthorized`.

![](https://github.com/LianwMS/WebApiF/blob/gh-pages/img/05-01-demo-2.png)
 
Finally, we set the value of the `Authorization` header to “Basic UGFycnk6MTIzNDU2” and send it over HTTPS to the same address again. The service now responds with the correct data.

### Summary

In this post we demoed how an OData API can be secured by basic authentication over HTTPS. You may additionally add authorization logic to the API by further customizing the `HttpBasicAuthorizeAttribute` class we created. Furthermore, you may also use other authentication methods such as OAuth2 to secure your OData API.
